# Horse Health Prediction using Machine Learning and Streamlit

## Introduction

This project is aimed at predicting the health of horses using machine learning algorithms and deploying the model in a Streamlit web application. Horse health is crucial, and early detection of health issues can be life-saving. This application allows users to input various features related to the horse's condition and get predictions about its health status.

## Features

- Machine Learning Models: We have trained several machine learning models using historical horse health data to make predictions about a horse's health status.
- Streamlit Web App: The project is deployed as a Streamlit web application, making it easy for users to interact with the model and get predictions.
- User-Friendly Interface: The web app provides a user-friendly interface for users to input relevant data and obtain health predictions.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

We have used a variety of machine learning algorithms to predict horse health. Some of the algorithms include:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The choice of algorithm can be selected by the user in the web application for predictions.

## Data

The machine learning models are trained on a dataset containing information about various health-related parameters and conditions of horses. The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size but can be obtained from kaggle.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/perarulalan15/Horse-health-prediction.git

2. Install the required Python packages:

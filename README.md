# Horse Health Prediction

## Introduction

This project aims to predict a horse's health using machine learning algorithms and deploying the model in a Streamlit web application and also in Django Framework. Horse health is crucial, and early detection of health issues can be life-saving. This application allows users to input various features related to the horse's condition and get predictions about its health status.

## Features

- Machine Learning Models: We have trained several machine learning models using historical horse health data to make predictions about a horse's health status.
- Streamlit Web App: The project is deployed as a Streamlit web application, making it easy for users to interact with the model and get predictions.
- Django Web Application: The model is seamlessly integrated into a Django project, offering a scalable and efficient web application.
- User-Friendly Interface: The web app provides a user-friendly interface for users to input relevant data and obtain health predictions.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

We have used a variety of machine-learning algorithms to predict horse health. Some of the algorithms include:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The algorithm can be selected by the user in the web application for predictions.

## Data

The machine learning models are trained on a dataset containing information about various health-related parameters and conditions of horses. The dataset is included in this repository but it can be obtained from Kaggle.

## Django Framework

Django is a high-level web framework for building web applications using the Python programming language. It follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern, or more specifically, the model-view-template (MVT) pattern, which is a slight variation of MVC. Django provides a set of tools and conventions to help developers build web applications quickly and efficiently.
